# MyRoom
My Room is a gamified productivity application that facilitates the daily routine of humans. It combines various beneficial applications and enables them to be accessed from one point.
These include habit and health trackers, clock, alarm, organizers, and many more. My Room tracks the user's habits and progress, enabling them to see their lives going better. 
Having such a simple design and structure will ensure that people will never get bored while using this program.
Alongside these, we use gamification elements so that users can earn points when they use the program regularly. And after that users can customize their room as they wish.
